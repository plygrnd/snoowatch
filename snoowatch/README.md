# SnooWatch

The friendly open-source Elasticsearch-based Subreddit analyzer

**NOTE** SnooWatch is currently being rewritten. DO NOT RELY ON THIS CODE AT PRESENT. It is not ready
for public consumption.

## Background

Snoowatch is a suite of tools to analyze submissions, users and comments on Reddit. It was initially created
to monitor a single subreddit, and ran within a homelab. It has since been refactored to run wholly
within the cloud, as an AWS Fargate/Elasticsearch application.

## Capabilities

* Index every post and comment within the subreddits of your choice
* Use Elasticsearch to monitor post/comment trends and create alerts as required
